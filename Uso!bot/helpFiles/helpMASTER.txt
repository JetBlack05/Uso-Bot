▬▬▬**Help for 'MASTER' commands**▬▬▬

Uso! <:Bot:317951180737347587> is an osu! bot made by Renondedju!
If you encounter any problem, please ask for some help here! https://discordapp.com/invite/mEeMPyK
**I'm now available in game ! Look for UsoBot**

The current command prefix is ``o!``

	➥ ``help`` Show this message

	➥ ``status <message> | <status>`` Change the bot's status
status can be : 'online', 'offline', 'idle', 'do_not_disturb' alias 'dnd', 'invisible'
→*ex. o!status Hi evryone ! | online*

	➥ ``test`` Tests the bot
→*ex. o!test*

	➥ ``kill`` Kills the bot
→*ex. o!kill*

	➥ ``r`` Automatically recommend you a beatmap (v2.0)

With this rework, you can now use options to customise your requests !
To use an option, simply type ``o!r /<option name> <option parameter>``

• ``/c <number>`` or ``/count <number>`` will allow you to request multiple beatmaps at once ! (up to 5)
• ``/r <'true' or 'false'>`` or ``/ranked <'true' or 'false'>`` will allow you to choose wether or not the map will be ranked
• ``/m <mods>`` or ``/mods <mods>`` will allow you to select witch mods you want to play
*(The only supported mods for now are HD, HR and DT)*
• ``/a <accuracy>`` or ``/accuracy <accuracy>`` allow you to change your 'future you' accuracy
• ``/pp <number>`` allow to change the pp value of the recomendation (for training purpose)
• ``/b (bpm)`` allow you to select the bpm
→*ex. o!r /c 5 /m HDDT*

	➥ ``user <your osu username> <mode>`` Displays user stats

• ``<Your osu username>`` can also be replaced with :
- your osu id (ex: ``7418575``)
- your osu user url *(ex: ``https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7418575``)*
- ``me`` if you linked your osu account with the bot (``o!link_user <your osu username/id>``)

• ``<mode>`` can be : ``osu``, ``ctb``, ``mania`` and ``taiko``
- If no mode is precised, the bot will automaticly return the Osu!standard mode stats
→*ex. o!user https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7418575 ctb*

	➥ ``mute <'on' or 'off'>`` **admins only** allows the bot to chat in the server or not *(if not the bot will answer in pm)*
→*ex. o!mute on*

	➥ ``dedicated_channel <'set' or 'remove'>`` **admins only** set the main channel of the bot in the channel where the command has been called 
*(Then, if someone calls the bot in another channel, he will be mentioned in the main channel of the bot with his command result)*
→*ex. o!dedicated_channel set*

	➥ ``link_user <osu username or osu id>`` Link your discord account to an osu! account (requiered for ``r`` and ``update_pp_stats``)
→*ex. o!link_user Renondedju*

	➥ ``update_pp_stats`` Updates your osu! pp stats *- use this if you have just done a really good score -* (this command is run automatically once every day for everyone)
